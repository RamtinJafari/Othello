    "# Othello (Reversi) Mini-Project Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This document provides a structured overview of the university mini-project for implementing the Othello game (also known as Reversi) in C++ as a console application. The project focuses on basic programming concepts like loops, conditions, functions, and file handling. It's divided into phases as suggested in the PDF, with required (mandatory) and optional (bonus) features. This overview can serve as a roadmap for implementation and as a basis for creating a UML diagram (e.g., class diagram showing relationships between entities like Game, Board, Player, and Bot).\n",
    "\n",
    "The game is a two-player strategy board game on an 8x8 grid where players place pieces to flip opponent's pieces by enclosing them. Black starts, and the player with more pieces at the end wins.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Phases\n",
    "\n",
    "The PDF suggests a phased approach to implementation. You can follow this sequentially or adjust based on mentor guidance. Each phase builds on the previous one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 1: Menu\n",
    "- **Description**: Create a main menu for user navigation.\n",
    "- **Features**:\n",
    "  - New Game: Start a new game (single-player or two-player).\n",
    "    - Single-player: User enters name; opponent is a bot.\n",
    "    - Two-player: Users enter names for both players.\n",
    "  - Load Game (Optional/Bonus): Load the last unfinished saved game.\n",
    "  - Help: Display explanations of menu usage, game rules, keyboard controls (e.g., W-A-S-D or arrow keys for movement).\n",
    "  - Game History: Show records of completed games, sorted by date (newest first). For each game:\n",
    "    - Player 1 name\n",
    "    - Player 2 name\n",
    "    - Piece counts at end\n",
    "    - Winner (or draw)\n",
    "    - Date and time\n",
    "  - Exit: Close the program.\n",
    "- **Implementation Notes**: Use console input/output. Store history in a text file for persistence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 2: Game Environment\n",
    "- **Description**: Set up the console-based game board and display.\n",
    "- **Features**:\n",
    "  - 8x8 grid displayed as a rectangular table.\n",
    "  - Symbols:\n",
    "    - Empty cell: Space or similar.\n",
    "    - Black piece: ● or B.\n",
    "    - White piece: ○ or W.\n",
    "  - Display current player's turn (name or color).\n",
    "  - Hint (Optional/Bonus): Mark valid move positions (e.g., with *).\n",
    "- **Implementation Notes**: No graphical libraries allowed; use text characters. Use Unicode box-drawing for a neat grid. Clear screen for updates (system(\"cls\") on Windows, system(\"clear\") on macOS/Linux).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 3: Start Game and Initial Setup\n",
    "- **Description**: Initialize the game board and handle player input for moves.\n",
    "- **Features**:\n",
    "  - Initial placement: 4 pieces in the center.\n",
    "    - White: Positions (4,4) and (5,5) [1-based indexing? Check PDF for row/column details].\n",
    "    - Black: Positions (4,5) and (5,4).\n",
    "  - Black always starts.\n",
    "  - Player movement: Use W-A-S-D or arrow keys to navigate the board and select a cell (use getch() for single-key input without Enter).\n",
    "- **Implementation Notes**: Represent the board as a 2D array or vector. Use structs for game state (e.g., board, players, turn).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 4: Move Logic and Flipping Pieces\n",
    "- **Description**: Validate and execute moves, including flipping.\n",
    "- **Features**:\n",
    "  - Move validation: Cell must be empty and enclose at least one opponent piece (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).\n",
    "  - On valid move: Place piece, flip enclosed opponent pieces, switch turn.\n",
    "  - Pass: If no valid moves, display \"Pass\" and skip turn.\n",
    "- **Implementation Notes**: Check all 8 directions for flips. Handle invalid inputs gracefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 5: End Game Conditions\n",
    "- **Description**: Detect game end and handle results.\n",
    "- **Features**:\n",
    "  - End when neither player has valid moves.\n",
    "  - Count pieces and declare winner (more pieces) or draw.\n",
    "  - Save game details to history file.\n",
    "  - Return to main menu.\n",
    "- **Implementation Notes**: Integrate with Game History from Phase 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 6: Single-Player Mode and Bot\n",
    "- **Description**: Implement AI opponent for single-player.\n",
    "- **Features**:\n",
    "  - Basic Bot (Required): Identify all valid moves, choose one randomly (use rand() from <cstdlib>).\n",
    "    - Pass if no moves.\n",
    "  - Advanced Bot (Optional/Bonus): Smarter strategies, e.g.:\n",
    "    - Maximize flips.\n",
    "    - Prioritize corners/edges.\n",
    "    - Simple scoring system.\n",
    "    - Algorithms like Minimax.\n",
    "- **Implementation Notes**: Seed random with time(nullptr). Bot should simulate human turns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Phase 7: Saving Results\n",
    "- **Description**: Persist data across sessions.\n",
    "- **Features**:\n",
    "  - Save completed game history to a text file (required).\n",
    "  - Save/Load Unfinished Game (Optional/Bonus): Store board state, turn, etc., for resumption via Load Game.\n",
    "- **Implementation Notes**: Use file I/O (<fstream>). Ensure data doesn't erase on program close.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Required Features (Mandatory)\n",
    "- Console-only implementation (no GUI).\n",
    "- Full game logic: Board setup, moves, flipping, passing, end conditions, winner determination.\n",
    "- Menu with New Game, Help, Game History, Exit.\n",
    "- Two-player mode.\n",
    "- Basic random bot for single-player.\n",
    "- Use structs for data (e.g., Game struct with board, players).\n",
    "- Clean code: Follow DRY, readable naming, functions for modularity.\n",
    "- Test each phase incrementally.\n",
    "- Handle inputs with getch() for smooth navigation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Optional Features (Bonus Points)\n",
    "- Load Game for unfinished games.\n",
    "- Save during game (e.g., via key press).\n",
    "- Advanced bot (e.g., Minimax).\n",
    "- Visual enhancements: ANSI colors for pieces/UI.\n",
    "- Custom board size (even numbers like 6x6 or 10x10).\n",
    "- Hints: Show valid moves.\n",
    "- Replay: View all moves from a completed game.\n",
    "- Scoreboard: Track wins across players.\n",
    "- Creative additions: Any ideas improving the game (e.g., difficulty levels).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Tips from PDF\n",
    "- **Coding Practices**: Clean code, avoid repetition, use functions.\n",
    "- **Libraries**: <cstdlib> and <ctime> for random; <conio.h> for getch (Windows); Unicode for visuals.\n",
    "- **Testing**: Test each section before proceeding.\n",
    "- **Evaluation Criteria**: Correct logic (moves, flips, end), code quality (readability, structure), UI clarity. Bonus for creativity/advanced features.\n",
    "- **Deadline**: January 5, 2026 (15 Di 1404 in Persian calendar).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Roadmap for Implementation\n",
    "1. **Setup Environment**: Install C++ compiler (e.g., g++). Create main.cpp with includes.\n",
    "2. **Implement Phase 1 (Menu)**: Build loop for menu selection. Use switch/case.\n",
    "3. **Implement Phase 2-3 (Board & Setup)**: Create board struct/array. Functions for display, init.\n",
    "4. **Implement Phase 4 (Moves)**: Functions for validateMove(), flipPieces(), getValidMoves().\n",
    "5. **Implement Phase 5 (End Game)**: Functions for checkEnd(), countPieces(), saveHistory().\n",
    "6. **Implement Phase 6 (Bot)**: Bot class/function with random move selection.\n",
    "7. **Implement Phase 7 (Saving)**: File read/write functions.\n",
    "8. **Add Optionals**: Prioritize based on time (e.g., hints first, then advanced bot).\n",
    "9. **Testing & Polish**: Unit tests for logic. Add colors/Unicode. Handle edge cases (e.g., full board).\n",
    "10. **Documentation**: Comment code. Prepare for submission."
